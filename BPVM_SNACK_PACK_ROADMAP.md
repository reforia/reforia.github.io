## Writing Guidelines

### Tone
- **Conversational** and approachable
- Use **analogies** (recipe/cake, header files, etc.)
- **Emojis** for visual breaks (üçø ü§Ø ‚úÖ ‚ùå)
- **"You" language** (talk to the reader directly)

### Structure
```markdown
## The Hook (Problem/Question)
Brief scenario or surprising fact

## The Explanation
1-2 core concepts with examples

## Quick Takeaway
Bullet-point summary

## Want More Details?
Link to deep-dive post

## Navigation
Series navigation links
```

### Code Examples
- **Minimal** code (only essentials)
- **Heavy commenting** in code blocks
- Prefer **pseudo-code** over full implementation
- Show **before/after** comparisons

### Images
- **Reuse** from original posts
- Add **captions** explaining the image
- Use `{: width="500"}` for reasonable sizing

### Length Target
- **800-1200 words** per snack
- **3-5 minute** read time
- **1-2 concepts** maximum per post

## File Naming Convention

```
YYYY-MM-DD-bpvm-snack-NN-slug.md

Examples:
2025-01-01-bpvm-snack-01-what-is-blueprint.md
2025-01-02-bpvm-snack-02-graph-system.md
```

## Tags

All posts include:
```yaml
tags: [Unreal, Engine, Blueprint, BPVM-Snack-Pack]
```

The `BPVM-Snack-Pack` tag creates an automatic collection page!
