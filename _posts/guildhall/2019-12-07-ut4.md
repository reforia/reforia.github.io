## Post Mortem
### What Went Well
- The layout design is organic and encourages players to roam around the level
- The layout encourages players to strategically play offensive or defensive move
- The aesthetic is consistent
- Two small bases, one giant midground, multiple branches, and alternative routes, push players to make a meaningful decision

### What Went Wrong
- The unaligned grid results in mesh clipping and lighting problems.
- Lack of post-process effect
- Interior lighting needs polish

### What I Learnt
- Multiplayer PVP level design is to encourage both players to make meaningful choices
- LoS blockers help hide and rearrange different paths for both teams
