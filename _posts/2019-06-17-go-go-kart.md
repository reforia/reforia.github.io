## Description
This project was chosen to give a fun and creative approach for a racing game, allowing us to explore a cartoony art style and to learn the Unreal engine. The project was completed over 16 weeks â€“ throughout the process, we struggled with being on a fixed timeline, working towards getting a strong and fun game feel and with trying to ensure that our game felt like a theme park. This process helped the entire team learn how to work as a large team of almost 50, and understand how to be part of a larger team in the games industry.
