## Post-Mortem
### What Went Well
- The encounter design successfully guides players to roam around the level in an interesting way
- The interactable environment is a good touch
- Reuse part of level but in another direction to make the different gameplay experience
- Use pickup, lighting, color, guidelines to guide players
- Transition – Arena – Transition – Arena – Transition -… Layout to help to control the game pace

### What Went Wrong
- The pickups have precision issues, where they sometimes clipping into construction at run-time
- Too many FXs, results in framerate loss sometimes
- Too many LoS blockers, results in AI sometimes unable to navigate properly

### What I Learnt
- Encounter Design can help control the game’s pace
- Encounters need to guide players to roam the level in an interesting way
- The scarce and variance of pickups should be increased to push the emotional curve to the peak
