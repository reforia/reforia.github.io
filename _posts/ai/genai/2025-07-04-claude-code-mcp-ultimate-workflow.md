## Introduction
There's one thing that's been haunting me throughout my entire game development career - context switching. You know the drill: you're deep in the zone, fixing a complex bug, and suddenly you need to check a P4 changelist, update a Jira ticket, reference some documentation in Confluence, and maybe check what's happening in the Git repo. By the time you've navigated through all these tools, you've completely lost your train of thought.

But what if I told you there's a way to bring all these tools directly into your AI assistant? What if you could ask Claude to check your P4 pending changes, update Jira tickets, search Confluence docs, and manage Git repositories - all from a single interface? That's exactly what we're going to build today with Claude Code and MCP (Model Context Protocol).

This isn't just about convenience - it's about creating a workflow that keeps you in the flow state, where your AI assistant becomes a true partner in your development process, not just a glorified autocomplete tool.

## What is MCP?
MCP (Model Context Protocol) is a standardized way for AI assistants to interact with external tools and data sources. Think of it as a bridge that allows Claude to directly communicate with your development tools, databases, and services. Instead of you manually switching between different applications, Claude can do it for you.

The beauty of MCP is that it's not just about read-only access - Claude can actually perform actions on your behalf. Need to create a Jira ticket? Claude can do it. Want to submit a P4 changelist? Claude's got you covered. Need to update documentation in Confluence? You guessed it.

## Setting up Claude Code
First, let's get Claude Code installed and configured. If you haven't already, head over to the [Claude Code documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) and follow the installation guide.

Once installed, you can verify everything is working by running:

```bash
claude --version
```

Claude Code comes with built-in MCP support, which means we can start adding servers right away. The key advantage of using Claude Code over the web interface is that it can interact with your local development environment, access your files, and execute commands on your behalf.

## Setting up MCP Servers

### GitHub Integration
Let's start with GitHub since it's the most straightforward. Run the following commands:

```bash
# Add GitHub MCP server
claude mcp add --transport sse github-server https://api.github.com/mcp

# List configured servers to verify
claude mcp list
```

The GitHub MCP server will handle authentication automatically when you first use it. You can test it by running:

```bash
claude /mcp__github__list_repos
```

### Perforce (P4) Integration
For Perforce, we need to set up a custom MCP server. P4 doesn't have an official MCP server, but we can create one using the generic command-line MCP approach:

```bash
# Add P4 MCP server for common operations
claude mcp add p4-server p4
```

This allows Claude to execute P4 commands directly. You can configure your P4 environment variables as usual (`P4PORT`, `P4USER`, `P4CLIENT`, etc.), and Claude will use them.

### Atlassian Jira Integration
For Jira, we can use the REST API through a generic HTTP MCP server:

```bash
# Add Jira MCP server
claude mcp add jira-server "https://your-domain.atlassian.net/rest/api/3"
```

You'll need to configure authentication with your Jira API token. Create a token in your Atlassian account settings and configure it in Claude's MCP settings.

### Confluence Integration
Similar to Jira, we can set up Confluence access:

```bash
# Add Confluence MCP server
claude mcp add confluence-server "https://your-domain.atlassian.net/wiki/rest/api"
```

## Creating the Ultimate Workflow

### Project Context Setup
The first step is to create a project-specific configuration. Create a `.claude.md` file in your project root:

```markdown
# Project: [Your Project Name]

## Development Environment
- P4 Depot: //depot/your-project/...
- Git Repository: your-org/your-project
- Jira Project: PROJ
- Confluence Space: PROJECT

## Common Tasks
1. Check P4 pending changes before commits
2. Update Jira tickets when fixing bugs
3. Reference Confluence documentation
4. Sync Git branches with P4 changes
5. Generate release notes from commit history

## Workflow Preferences
- Always check P4 status before major changes
- Update Jira tickets with commit references
- Create Confluence pages for major features
- Maintain Git-P4 sync for external collaborators
```

### Daily Workflow Examples

Here's how your daily workflow might look:

**Morning Standup Prep:**
```
Hey Claude, can you help me prepare for standup? 
- Check my P4 pending changes
- List my assigned Jira tickets
- Show recent commits in our main Git branch
- Find any Confluence pages I've updated recently
```

**Bug Fix Workflow:**
```
I found a bug in the rendering system. Can you:
1. Check if there are similar issues in Jira
2. Look up the rendering documentation in Confluence
3. Check recent P4 changes to rendering files
4. Help me create a proper bug fix plan
```

**Feature Development:**
```
I'm starting work on the new inventory system. Please:
1. Create a Jira epic for this feature
2. Set up a feature branch in Git
3. Create a P4 workspace for the new feature
4. Draft a Confluence page for the design document
```

### Advanced Integration Scenarios

**Automated Code Reviews:**
```
I have a P4 changelist ready for review. Can you:
1. Generate a summary of the changes
2. Check for any related Jira tickets
3. Update the tickets with the changelist number
4. Create a Confluence page with the review notes
```

**Release Management:**
```
We're preparing for release. Please:
1. Generate release notes from Git commits
2. Update all resolved Jira tickets to "Done"
3. Create a release documentation page in Confluence
4. Prepare the P4 branch for the release build
```

## Security Considerations
When setting up this workflow, keep these security practices in mind:

1. **API Token Management**: Store API tokens securely and rotate them regularly
2. **Access Scope**: Limit MCP server permissions to only what's necessary
3. **Audit Logging**: Keep track of what actions Claude performs on your behalf
4. **Team Policies**: Ensure your team is aware of AI-assisted workflows

> **Warning**: Never commit API tokens or sensitive credentials to version control. Use environment variables or secure credential storage.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

**MCP Server Connection Issues:**
```bash
# Check server status
claude mcp list

# Test specific server
claude mcp get server-name
```

**Authentication Problems:**
Most authentication issues can be resolved by:
1. Regenerating API tokens
2. Checking environment variables
3. Verifying server URLs
4. Testing manual API calls first

**Performance Optimization:**
- Use specific commands rather than broad queries
- Cache frequently accessed data
- Set up proper indexes in your tools
- Monitor API rate limits

## Results
After implementing this workflow, my development efficiency has increased dramatically. Instead of constantly switching between tools, I can focus on the actual problem-solving. Claude becomes like having a super-powered assistant who knows all your tools and can execute complex workflows in seconds.

The real magic happens when you start chaining operations together. For example, when I'm investigating a bug, I can ask Claude to check P4 history, find related Jira tickets, pull up documentation, and even suggest fixes - all in one conversation.

What used to take 15-20 minutes of context switching and tool navigation now takes 2-3 minutes of natural conversation with Claude. That's not just a productivity gain - it's a complete transformation of how I approach development work.

The future of development isn't just about AI writing code - it's about AI understanding your entire development ecosystem and helping you navigate it seamlessly. This MCP-powered workflow is just the beginning of that future.
