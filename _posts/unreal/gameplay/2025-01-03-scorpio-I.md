## Introduction
Scorpio is a RPG kit for Unreal Engine 5 that was developed by me solo, it's not an open-source framework nor do I have any plan to monetize it. It's a personal project that I want to create as a centralized game framework solution for my other game projects.

So what this series is all about if it's not open-sourced? Well, during the development of Scorpio (And of course use it in game project), I have already benefited a lot from the architecture and approaches taken, It also saved a lot of time and effort for me during development, so I'd like to share the architecture and thought process behind, problems and solutions, as well as code snippets and examples, it will be great if I can help other indie developers take inspiration from it, or provide thoughts to help me improve.

## Motivation
I've seen tons of tutorials and guides on how to create a specific gameplay system in a very basic or often hacky manner, these tutorials are great for beginners to understand the basic concept, or just rush a demo quickly, yet from my years of experience in the industry, I can barely remember any of these tutorials being used in actual production environment. (I'm talking about stuff like create a combat system in 20 mins - kind of tutorial) 

What's the biggest issue with them? Well, Architecture. So many times we seen a cool plugin in marketplace and just jam it into our project and turns out that it doesn't work smoothly with our existing system. And even more times we pulled the whole plugin in just to use one of the hundred features in it. We effectively opened the portal to invite other modules freely invade our depot. At the beginning we thought it's manageable, but as more and more incoherent systems, plugins, utilities, etc intrude into our project. It quickly becomes an unmaintainable mess, a lot projects didn't even see the light of day because of this. So I want this series to cover more about the architecture, thought process behind a decision, and why behind a system, rather than just how to create it. It doesn't necessarily mean that the architecture is anywhere near perfect, but at least I hope it can be an initiative for more discussion on this topic among fellow indie developers or beginners.

>A common dilemma: Plugin A wrote it's core in a `GameInstance` class, great, but oh no, we already wrote our `GameInstance`, now we have two approaches, we either copy paste logics in Plugin A's `GameInstance` into our version, and then searching through all the blueprints and manually rerouting all the cast from Plugin A's `GameInstance` to our version. Or vice versa, we merge our stuff into Plugin A's `GameInstance`. Great, but oh no, there's another cool Plugin B, and Plugin C, D, E... that all did the same thing... Arrrrgh!

## Goal
The goal of this project is to create a universal RPG framework for Unreal Engine to solve the following pain points:
- **Reusability**: A modular system that can be easily integrated into any project with plug-and-play support for RPG genres.
- **Scalability**: A system that can be expanded upon without breaking existing functionalities
- **Centralized Solution**: A system that different project can submit their game agnostic improvements back to the plugin stream, seamlessly benefiting all projects.
- **Complexity Reduction**: A system that abstracts the complexity for some universal modules, including save load system, inventory, quest, dialogue, character, skill, etc.
- **Faster Iteration**: A system that streamlines gameplay logics into modular logic blocks, allowing mix-and-match possibilities for new gameplay under rapid development.
- **Lower Cost**: Together, lower the margin cost for indie games under certain genres, such as RPG, by providing a solid foundation to build upon.

## Functional Relationship
From functional perspective, we have Unreal Engine as the base that provide the core functionalities for creating a video game, but not really pushing towards any specific genre, as a general purpose engine designed for arbitrarily any game genre (Or even non games) this is very much expected. 

Building upon this base, we have Scorpio, it's more a RPG genre specific framework, although it shouldn't stop the developer from expanding it to create other genre like racing game or FPS games (In fact, it's also quite common that a RPG game has such mechanics, it's just not the goal for Scorpio to provide support, for example, CoD like gunplay, etc.)

A game project will then depend on Scorpio, and utilize its framework to build the game. Scorpio support creating and expanding from the basic framework with little to no modification to the core code, and it's designed to be easily integrated into any project.

## Source Control Relationship
Observing the source control structure, essentially every game project will depend on Scorpio, for now it's not a copy-paste relationship but a direct stream mapping. (for now as I don't have too much game projects working in parallel, when the scale grows, it should absolutely having local Scorpio fork for each project)

The benefit of this structure is that, any improvement or bug fix in Scorpio can be easily submitted back to the plugin stream, and all projects can benefit from it instantly. It also allows a centralized solution for all projects, and a single point of entry for all game agnostic improvements. In the future, Scorpio might be exposed as multiple modules so that a project can choose to only use a subset of Scorpio. This setup in p4 takes advantage of stream mapping, meaning during the development of Game Project A, if we decided to fix a bug or add a feature in Scorpio, we can just modify it right away, p4 will automatically submit different files from the same changelist to different streams. Allowing multiple projects battle-test the same framework.

>It's important to realize that the benefit will soon become a problem if there are more developers working under the system, as different project might unintentionally receive changes submitted from other projects and introduce regressions, but for me as a solo developer, this is not a concern. If this becomes a problem, we would add another layer of stream mapping to resolve it, so like each project won't directly submit back to the actual shared Scorpio stream, nor pulling the head of the shared stream, any change should go to the project mapped stream, and then in order to have the project being submitted to Scorpio, another layer of approval and merge process needs to be there. Then each project can have a chance to cherry pick features again back to their local Scorpio stream.

## Scope
Here's a list of features that Scorpio will cover. So far, Scorpio provide the following features (Ordered by importance):
### Core
- Auto Save & Load for World State
- Automatically handle save and load for the whole game's world state
- Message Bus
- Internal message bus for communication between systems without direct reference
- Runtime Constant Data
- Constant data that can be accessed at runtime, always loaded for quick access
- Macro based auto code generation
- Generate boilerplate code for common classes~
### Asset Management
- Character
  - Player & NPC has their own character data, allowing expansion by underlying project
- Character Schedule
  - NPC can have their own schedule to follow
- Interaction Settings
  - Define whether and how player can interact with an object
- Area
  - Indicate when player enter or exit an area, an area can contain multiple locations, usually all locations in an area will be streamed in/out together
- Location
  - Indicate when player enter or exit a location
- Persistent Flag
  - A simple flag asset that will be persisted, can be used for arbitrary anything that needs to persistent, like player has seen a cutscene, etc. Note that for interactions, dialogues, quests they will have their own persistence system, this is used for flexible data that's more game specific.
- Reward & Reward Group
  - A reward can contain items, or attributes, a reward group can contain multiple rewards for reusability
- Vendor
  - Any NPC can be a vendor, which contains a list of items that can be sold to player
- Quest
  - A FSM based Quest system
- Dialogue
  - A FSM based Dialogue system
### Gameplay
- Custom Time
- GAS
- Interaction System
- Camera Manager
- Skill Manager
- Inventory Manager
- Char Stats Manager
- Game Flow Manager
- Map Manager
- Narrative Manager
- Notification Manager
- Persistent Manager
### Modular Gameplay
- Gameplay Event
  - For stuff like "Request A UI", "Start A Quest", etc, they are a one off event that can be triggered by any system
- Gameplay Condition
  - For stuff like "Is Player In Area", "Is Player Has Item", etc, they are a condition that can be checked by any system
- Gameplay Task
  - For stuff like "Reaching A Location", "Collecting An Item", etc, they are a task that will be persistent until being completed or failed by Quest system
### World Building Tool
- Spline Actor
- Procedural Floor Actor
### World
- Streaming
- Area
- Location
- Teleportation
### UI & Feedback
- Notification
- Modular UI & Stack
### Render
- Utility Shaders for UI
- Utility Shaders for Pose Process

## Limitation
And here're a few limitations:
### Networking
  - Support to network is not planned at this moment due to workload, but the architecture didn't prevent it from being added in the future. (We will need to implement a server side network hub to serialize and transmit net events around, and client side network hub to handle each of them. It needs to be manually implemented because the major drive is `UObject` in this framework, which doesn't natively support replication, the underlying project would also need to implement network ready logics)
### Animation
  - Animation will need to be handled by the underlying project, Scorpio aren't planning to provide any animation related features, this is because animation is very project specific and it's hard to create a universal solution for it. Plus Unreal Engine already has a very powerful animation system built-in.
### Render & Visual
  - Scorpio will only provide utility shaders for UI and pose process, it won't provide any production ready visual assets or materials, same reason above, it's very project specific and it's hard to create a universal solution for it. Plus Unreal Engine already has a very powerful rendering system built-in.

## Let the journey begin
Starting from the next post, we will dive into the architecture of Scorpio, and start building the core systems. Stay tuned!
