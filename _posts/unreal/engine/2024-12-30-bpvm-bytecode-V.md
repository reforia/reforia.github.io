## The Story So Far
We have been exploring the compiling process of a blueprint in Unreal Engine, from hitting the `Compile` button all the way to the numerous `EExprToken` being emitted to a serialized form, but we havent yet actually see them in a real world case. So in this post, we will create a simple blueprint, add a bit of logics to it, and then analyze the bytecode generated from it. We will also discuss a bit on where this learning can be applied in real world game development. Without further ado, let's get started.

## Prerequisite


## Create a Blueprint Asset

## Add a custom function

## Call the function in event graph

## Compile and Save

## Bytecode Analysis

## Ubergraph

## CustomPrintString

## Conclusion
