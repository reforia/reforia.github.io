### Jayden
I started creating games in 2014 and have participated in multiple AAA and Indie projects. With a well-shaped game development knowledge base, I work as a Technical Designer and now Associate Technical Director, Level Design at Ubisoft. 

My passion is to bring vivid games to life with the power of technology and a detail-focused mindset. My interests span across design, tech, and art.
